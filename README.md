*About Cowlendar*

Welcome to Cowlendar, a discord bot designed to keep track of the attendance of members on Team 5801.


*Why Cowlendar?*

In order to be a part of Team 5801, there is an attendance threshold that must be kept. However, this attendance threshold used to be very difficult to keep track of,
as the way we used to keep track of attendance was through a Google form that everyone used to sign in. It took a lot of time, having to input First and Last name, email,
division you were signing in for, the times you were going to be here, the date, you get the point. What was worse is that, even with the google form, there was no set amount
of dates that were being kept track of letting administrators know if a date was supposed to be required or not. So, it was a mess of forms that were all out of wack, took a
lot of time to fill out, and in the end, didn't even do its job very well. This is why Cowlendar was made.


*What is Cowlendar?*

Cowlendar is a discord bot that was made to make attendance tracking simple. Everyone on the team is already on our team's discord server, so everyone would be able to log in
to a place that was always accessible to them. 

For a member, logging in is as simple as typing one command into our #login channel:

/login (Time Started - Time Ended (ex. 3:00pm - 6:00pm))

For an admin, setting a date that a member has to be here for is as simple as:

/add_date_default - for dates that are always the same
/add_date (division the date is for (ex. programming)) (time which the division is meeting for (ex. 3:00pm - 6:00pm)) 

It makes for a super simple logging process that makes logging in simple for the end user, and simple for the admin who wants to gather the data. With this system,
the dates required for each member is set and stone, and data is easy accessible through the /export command, allowing all of the data to be compiled into a CSV file
for anyone to see.

Tracking attendance shouldn't be that difficult. With it being complicated, mentors and students are both taking time out of the build season that could be spend actually learning
about robotics. This discord bot makes the perfect solution for logging in to be as simple and necessary as possible so that time can be spent more valuably.
